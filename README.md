# md_parser
Testing Markdown parser to format md files (Roam Research to Obsidian)

 - Best working example is using VS code plugin - [Tidy Markdown](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tehnix.vscode-tidymarkdown&ssr=false) to format md files from Roam Research
    - But it still has some issues in formatting fenced code blocks - it adds additional fences (```) when it encounters curly braces ({})
